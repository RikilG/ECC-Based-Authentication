## About The Project

This repository implements the steps given by the ECC model proposed by Kumar, V., Ahmad, M., Kumari, A., [A Secure Elliptic Curve Cryptography Based Mutual Authentication Protocol for Cloud-assisted TMIS, Telematics and Informatics (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2018.09.001),
and provides analysis w.r.t previous crypto system proposed by [Li et al](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.02.002).

The main aim of this project is to simulate a system similar to the proposed protocol. Therefore, the model implements all the required steps given in the protocol and shows its working without relying on a network based model.

Built With [Python](https://www.python.org)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

```sh
sudo apt install python3 # if python is not installed
pip install pycryptodome # make sure pip supports python 3 and not python 2
```

### Installation
 
1. Clone this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RikilG/ECC-Based-Authentication.git
cd ECC-Based-Authentication
```
2. Run program
```sh
cd src/proposed #for running proposed protocol
python main.py
```
